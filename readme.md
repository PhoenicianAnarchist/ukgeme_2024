# UK General Election Misrepresentation Error

An overview of misrepresentation error within the 2024 UK General Election, and
other related statistics (e..g the "right wing" voter base split between
`Conservative` and `Reform UK`).

Due to the changes in constituency boundaries, some data for changes since the
last election won't be included.

## ./scripts/fetch_bbc2024.py

This script will scrape the election data from the [BBC page][]. There is no
guarantee that this data will remain available for any length of time, or be
in a stable format, so this script _will_ stop working at some point.
